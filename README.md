# monte-carlo

a Python program that simulates a dice game. The number of sides on each 
die, the number of dice, and the number of simulations to perform will all be taken from user input. After
each simulation, the program will calculate the sum of the numbers on the dice. Then, after the specified
number of simulations, the program will produce an estimate of the probability of each possible sum. This
is a simple version of a well-known computational technique known as Monte Carlo
